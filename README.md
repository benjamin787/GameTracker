# NBA Border

A chrome extension that adjusts a full-screen stream to add a stats panel on the side. If the extension is activated (by clicking the basketball icon in the toolbar) every full-screen will be altered in this way, whether it's a game or not. Turn it off by clicking the icon again. You can choose the team's box score that you wish to see with drop-down menus.
